# CMPG-323-Overview---32692382-
This is an overview for CMPG 323 projects
## The following repositories will be created and used for the different projects:
- CMPG 323 Project 2 for the second project
- CMPG 323 Project 3 for the third project
- CMPG 323 Project 4 for the fourth project
- CMPG 323 Project 5 for the fifth project
## The use of a .gitignore file within each project 
.gitignore files will be used within each project to exclude specific files from being committed and tracked. Files such as cache and those that are irrelevant to the project will be ignored including the ones with sensitive information such as passwords.
## The storage of credentials and sensitive information
Credentials and sensitive information will not be stored on the GitHub repository because a public git can be accessed by anyone. Even private Git repositories are not 100% safe, when third party applications are integrated into the repository, the private repository can be exposed to third parties. If needs be, credentials and sensitive information will be encrypted before being stored, they will only be decrypted when there is a need to use them in cleartext.
